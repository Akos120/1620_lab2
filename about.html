    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>My name is Agnes Ko, and I am a new CIT student of BCIT. I'm currently<br>
        living in Ontario right now, so compared to everyone actually in BC, I'm <br>
        3 hours ahead. I don't have any previous knowledge or experience in <br>
        computers or programming, but it seems quite interesting and I'm excited <br>
        to learn. </p>
    <p>I enjoy staying inside watching videos, live streams, and sleeping.<br>
        I also like to travel from time to time. The most recent trip I took was <br>
        to South Korea and Japan two summers ago. It was a lot of fun, and I saw <br>
        many great sights! </p>
